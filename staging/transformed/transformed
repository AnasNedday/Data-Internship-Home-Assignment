At Self, our mission is to help millions of people build credit and save money on their journey toward financial security.&nbsp;There are about 100 million people in the US who have low credit scores or who have no access to credit at all. Sadly, there aren\u2019t many options for these people. Most banks aren\u2019t doing anything material to change the situation because it\u2019s not profitable for them to do so. Bad credit or no credit history can be barriers to renting an apartment or getting certain jobs, let alone buying a car or house. And if you can get a loan with a low credit score, you\u2019re very likely to pay a lot more in interest over the life of that loan.&nbsp;Our team is passionate about challenging the status quo of the credit industry by giving people accessible and affordable tools to take control of their credit. Executing on our mission requires deep collaboration across our teams to ensure our products reach the people who can most benefit from them.&nbsp;We're looking for people who share a passion for our mission and relate to why we do what we do. At Self, we want to work with people who are driven to tackle challenges, bring unique perspectives, find solutions and help make the financial space a better place for our consumers.

Sadly, they have few options. Most banks and financial institutions don\u2019t make any material effort to address this situation because it\u2019s not profitable for them to do so. Poor credit or a lack of credit history can create major barriers to renting an apartment or getting certain jobs, let alone buying a car or house. Even if you can get a loan, with a low credit score you\u2019re very likely to pay much more in interest and fees over the life of that loan.&nbsp;Self Financial, Inc. is a venture-backed, financial services startup based in Austin, TX. Our mission is to address this inequity by helping millions of traditionally-underserved people build credit and save money on their journey toward financial security.&nbsp;In addition to our positive mission, we also foster an open, welcoming, and fun culture, and take pride in being one of Austin\u2019s best places to work.&nbsp;Benefits and Perks:We have the compensation and benefits you expect.
